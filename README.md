# Inverse Reinforcement Learning

Implementation of Inverse Reinforcement Learning Algorithm (IRL). Mainly for experimental & educational purposes.

# Implementation

## Expert policy

- Q-learning

## IRL implementation

- Linear IRL (Ng & Russell 2000) [[Paper](https://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/icml00-irl.pdf)]

# How to use

1. git clone the repository.
2. Execute the jupyter notebook code blocks in order.
3. The notebook is explained in a very detailed manner for gaining deeper understanding into the code and results. Improvements and future work are desribed in the notebook.

# Dependencies

- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Gym

# Contributing

Please feel free to create a Pull Request for adding implementations of the IRL algorithms and improvements.
